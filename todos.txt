Methods that still need to be implemented:

1. Vectorized hazard/survival/pdf calculations for an arbitrary length of t (i.e. broadcast rows of x)
2. Censoring based on log-normal which uses the means of the columns rather than assuming a standard normal.
3. Proximal gradient descent
4. Coordinate descent for the univariate optimization
5. Experiments with IRLS for Hessian/2nd order optimization
6. Log-normal and other distributions
