Fixes before package goes live
1) hyperparameter tuning notebook
2) add option to run python3 -m to the run_pytest_.sh files
3) fix issues with run_pytest_multivariate: tests/test_multivariate_scaling.py
4) Add sksurv and other packages to readme
5) Full commit on pypi (test on local conda env)
6) Prepare blog post
7) tweet about it


Methods that still need to be implemented:

1. Vectorized hazard/survival/pdf calculations for an arbitrary length of t (i.e. broadcast rows of x)
2. Vectorize the beta_thresh input/output
3. Censoring based on log-normal which uses the means of the columns rather than assuming a standard normal.
4. Coordinate descent for the univariate optimization (check if similar to Nelder-Mead)
5. Experiments with IRLS for Hessian/2nd order optimization
6. Proximal gradient descent
7. Log-normal and other distributions (non-monotonic hazard)
8. Active set speedups
9. Compare solution path to sksurv
from sksurv.util import Surv
from sksurv.linear_model import CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis
10. Need a more elegant way to try different optimization routines. Should be an internal method like (try_optim(approach-'l-bfgs-g')) with a for loop around methods ('nelder-mead','SLSQP', etc)
